### Ingredients
<span class="org-level-1">* 6 cups chicken broth, divided</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 2 shallots, diced</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 1/2 cup dry white wine</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* sea salt to taste</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* freshly ground black pepper to taste</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 4 tablespoons butter</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</span>

### Directions
<span class="org-level-1">* In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet,  and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes.</span>
<span class="org-level-1">* Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</span>
