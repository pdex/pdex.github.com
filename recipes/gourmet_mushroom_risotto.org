### Ingredients
* 6 cups chicken broth, divided
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced
* 1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced
* 2 shallots, diced
* 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* sea salt to taste
* freshly ground black pepper to taste
* 3 tablespoons finely chopped chives
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Directions
* In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.
* Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.
* Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet,  and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes.
* Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
